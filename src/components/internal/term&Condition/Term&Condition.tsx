        If the parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the Central Arbitration Committee (“CAC”) and, where appropriate, the CAC’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“CAC Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the CAC website <a href="https://www.gov.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.gov.uk/</a>. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the CAC Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the CAC Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable CAC rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in a location mutually agreed by both parties, and United Kingdom law shall apply. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

      <p className="mb-4">
        The Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in the United Kingdom courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use. Instead, this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

        In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Application be commenced more than 2 years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

      <p className="mb-4">
        The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
